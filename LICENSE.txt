Beepola Licence
---------------
The bits of the code written by me, Chris Cowley, are copyright me and may not
be used in any derivative work without written permission UNLESS:-

  a) I am credited somewhere for the bits I wrote.
  b) Your derivative work is made available to the general public, at no cost.
  c) You publish, in full, the source code for any derivative work with full 
     instructions for compiling it using publicly available tools.

The bits of the code not written by me (the Z80 code for the beeper engines) are
the copyright of their respective authors and, in some cases are essentially
used by Beepola without the permission of the original copyright owners. As far
as I'm aware, none of the original authors or copyright holders has a problem
with this, but I would strongly advocate applying the three criteria above
(crediting, making available at no cost, publishing source) to any derivative
works made that include that code, as I have done in Beepola.

For the avoidance of any doubt: all songs or compiled code created with Beepola
are NOT "derived works" under this licence, and may be used freely. :)

In short, do what you like with this stuff, but please credit anyone whose
work you use, publish your source and, where appropriate, binaries for
free. Play nicely.
