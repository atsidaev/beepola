Beepola Release History
=======================
 1. ROMBeep
 2. Plip Plop, Stocker.
 3. TMB Drums.
 
v1.06.01 - 22/Oct/2010
----------------------
 1. Fix drums sounding twice when a new note is entered under some
    circumstances.

v1.06.00 - 13/Oct/2010
----------------------
 1. Fixed compatibility with WINE (caused by differences between the way
    WINE handles waveOut API compared to Windows). This was inadvertently
    broken in versions 1.03.00 - v1.05.03
 2. Improved sound reproduction and timing.
 3. Added ROMBeep engine as a compile-time only option (see the Beeper Engine
    dropdown list in the Compile dialog). This is a compact, pseudo 2 channel
    engine using arpeggios and the BEEP routine from the Spectrum ROM. It will
    therefore work correctly on 16K Spectrums or in low, contended, memory on
    other models.

v1.05.03 - 28/Aug/2010
----------------------
 1. Toolbar hints are now displayed while a song is playing.
 2. Fixed a number of issues related editing ornaments in the Savage engine.
 
v1.05.02 - 24/Aug/2010
----------------------
 1. Added FX columns to Savage engine, see online help for usage information.
 2. FIX: Fixed TAB behaviour within the pattern editor.
 3. Updated keyboard layout dialog.
 4. Improved drum entry behaviour to allow jamming when auto-inc is set to 0,
    and to autoincrement in pattern editor for engines with fewer than 10 drums
 5. FIX: Copy and Paste now correctly copies Savage effects data (Glis,Orn,etc)
 6. Ornaments in the Savage engine can now be looped (click the "Looped"
    checkbox for the selected ornament to enable this).
 7. Updated /songs/ folder with new material.

v1.05.01 - 17/Aug/2010
----------------------
 1. FIX: After editing a song using the Savage engine, open an existing song
    written for The Music Box. Savage Ornament editor remains displayed.
 2. FIX: Bugs loading Z80 files into the song ripper. It should now cope
    properly with 128 snapshots (including variants such as Pentagon &
    Scorpion) and Timex machines.
 3. FIX: Opening a Savage engine song using the command line or a *.bbsong file
    association incorrectly selected the Special FX engine in the engine
    dropdown in v1.05.00.
 4. FIX: Pattern play (F4) was playing the first row again after going through
    the pattern.
 5. Added Edit->Pattern->Expand x3 and Shrink /3 for tripling/thirding
    patterns.
 6. /songs/ folder updated with new material.

v1.05.00 - 15/Aug/2010
----------------------
 1. Improved timer resolution of Z80 emulation on some systems.
 2. Fixed bug when attempting to export a WAV file to a file that is in use.
 3. Fixed Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V issues, when copying or pasting text from an edit box.
 4. Fixed missing colon after DIV_2 label in assebler output for Phaser1
    engine, which was foiling some assemblers.
 5. Added AutoStep value of 0 (don't advance cursor).
 6. Added Savage engine, by Jason C Brooke (reversed engineered from part 2 of
    the game Savage by Probe Software - thanks to barmaley_m and Shiru).
 7. Added Tools->Options dialog with options for Show Column Numbers and a
    Hex/Dec switch for row labels in the pattern editor.
 8. Added Edit->Pattern->Expand & Edit->Pattern->Shrink facilities.
 9. Improved support for non-QWERTY keyboards (specifically, French AZERTY, and
    German/Polish QWERTZ layouts). Plus '1' and 'A' keys both now function as
    rest/note-off on those engines that support note-off.
10. The pattern compression algorithm in all previous versions of Beepola was
    not working correctly. Beepola now produces smaller compiled songs files,
    particularly noticable with the SpecialFX engine which now compresses
    percussion data independely of the tone channels. e.g. ChuckRock.bbsong
    now compiles to 1797 bytes instead of 1983 bytes in v1.04.
11. Added TAP/Z80 song ripper to File->Import menu. Currently rips songs
    compliled with the original Music Box editor for Spectrum, with Shiru's
    original Phaser1 editor for the Spectrum, and the Beepola version of
    Phaser1.
12. Various other minor mods, fixes and improvements.

v1.04.00 - 22/Jun/2010
----------------------
 1. Fixed check mark appearing against "Save As..." menu item.
 2. Added a splash of music to the About Box for no particularly good reason.
 3. Added Edit->Pattern->Swap Channels...  (swaps data between channel 1 and
    channel 2 for the currently-selected pattern).
 4. Added Edit->Pattern->Append...  (appends a pattern onto the end of another)
 5. Fixed delay between patterns when playing a song in the editor.
 6. When entering new patterns into the song layout list, the pattern editor is
    now automatically updated to show the newly-added pattern.
 7. Added File->Import->Vortex Tracker II Text Module (imports 2 channels of
    melody data from a VTII module file, ignoring any ornamention or command
    data).
 8. Added Edit->Song->Adjust Tempo... (adjusts the tempo of all patterns in a
    song).
 9. Fixed show-stoppng bugs in the "in-game music" option for both Music Box
    and Music Studio engines. I'm amazed nobody noticed that it didn't work
    properly!
10. Added "Most Recently Used" file list to File menu.
11. Auto-Inc now goes up to 8 (was tempted to make it go to 11...)
12. Pressing DELETE in the pattern editor now advances by the specified
    Auto-Inc amount instead of always by 1.

 6. Split the player and song data for all beeper engines to allow for a single
    copy of each player routine to easily support multiple songs.

    saving only song data (with no player routine) as either a TAP file, a BIN
    file, or ASM listing.
 8. Cleaned up the user interface a little (new toolbar, icons, etc.).
 9. Some new demo songs added.

v1.02.00 - 10/May/2010
----------------------
 1. You can no longer change the current cell in the pattern display using the
    mouse when a song/pattern is being played.
 2. Fixed a problem in the Special FX player that caused notes at the start of
    a song to be detuned until notes were present on both channels.

 4. Doing various things such as entering or deleting a note, during song
    playback is no longer permitted.
